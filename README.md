# Cloud SQL API for CheckUp

This microservice was developed as part of our TAMUhack 2022 project which utilized Google Cloud Platform to access a Cloud PostgreSQL instance, which stores the data for our project, CheckUp.

The API is simple and has two primary endpoints:
- `POST /insert` - insert data into the database
- `GET /select` - query data from the database
